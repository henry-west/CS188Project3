A snarky midwestern cooking app. The greatest food in the universe

The home page contains a featured recipe, a button to view the Midwestern Food Philosophy (basically an info page for the app), and a featured menu.

The action bar contains buttons for searching (currently non-functional) and the user's favorites page (currently filled with random recipes, not the user's actual favorites).

The overflow menu allows the user to navigate to any category: State food, holiday food, potluck food, and bacon, beer, and cheese food. Under each of these categories, the recipes are divided into four tabs: appetizers, sides/salads, main dishes, and desserts. After clicking on a recipe, the user will be taken to a new page that has three tabs for directions, summary, and ingredients. Currently, clicking on any recipe that is not a main dish does nothing, and all main dishes lead to the recipe page for grilled corn.
